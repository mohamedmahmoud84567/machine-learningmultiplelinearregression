# machine-learningmultiplelinearregression
In this project, we'll be using the Boston house-prices dataset. The dataset consists of 13 features of 506 houses . We'll fit a model on the 13 features to predict the value of the houses.
First,we will Create a regression model using scikit-learn's LinearRegression and assign it to model.
Fit the model to the data

Second, we will Predict the values of some input data
